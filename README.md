To use;
-The program will read every PDF called "to_ocrX.pdf" where X is a number between 1 and 10, and output them to "outputX.pdf". 
	(OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, which is the name for this process.)
-Can handle a maximum of 10 PDFs. (Or maybe 9.) This is just because I'm too lazy to increase the number, but it shouldn't matter.
-Each PDF should have <= 100 pages. It can probably handle a bit more, but I wouldn't risk it.

Before running;
-Remove everything in all the image folders (just open them and delete them) if you are changing which PDFs you are opening. 
	Otherwise, it may add pages from past PDFs in the interpretation.
-Deleting all the output .txt files might be a good idea so you don't get them confused with past processes, but won't break if you don't.

In the end;
-Use the text files to make a composite of the output. This can be really laggy in Word/Google Docs, so I'd do it in notepad.
-Attempting to paste it elsewhere will be really laggy, so you might just want to keep it in Notepad.
-Hopefully I fixed the page count.
